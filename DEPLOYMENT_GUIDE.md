# FoodVilla Deployment Guide

## Issue Fixed: "Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON"

This error was occurring because:
1. The app was trying to fetch data from Swiggy's API
2. In production, CORS restrictions were blocking the API calls
3. Instead of JSON, the app was receiving HTML error pages
4. When trying to parse HTML as JSON, it caused the error

## Solutions Implemented:

### 1. Environment-based API URLs
- Development: Uses proxy configuration
- Production: Uses direct API URLs with proper headers

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Detects when HTML is received instead of JSON
- Graceful fallback to mock data when API fails
- User-friendly error messages

### 3. Fallback Data System
- Mock restaurant data is used when API is unavailable
- App continues to work even without live API data

### 4. Improved Data Structure Handling
- Components handle both API response format and mock data format
- Flexible data parsing for different response structures

## Deployment Steps:

### For Netlify:
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `build` folder to Netlify
3. The `_redirects` file will handle SPA routing

### For Vercel:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Vercel will automatically build and deploy

### For Other Platforms:
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Deploy the contents of the `build` folder
3. Ensure your hosting platform supports SPA routing

## Development vs Production:

### Development:
- Uses proxy in package.json
- API calls go through localhost proxy
- CORS extension may be needed

### Production:
- Direct API calls with proper headers
- Fallback to mock data if API fails
- No CORS extension needed

## Testing the Fix:

1. The app should load without the JSON parsing error
2. If Swiggy API is blocked, mock data will be displayed
3. All features (search, filters) work with both live and mock data
4. Error messages are user-friendly

## Notes:
- The app now works offline with mock data
- Live API data is used when available
- CORS issues are handled gracefully
- No more "Unexpected token" errors
